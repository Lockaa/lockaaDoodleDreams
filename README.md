   ## Description

For out final project, we decided to come together to create a React + Vite site that allows users to register and generate images. These images are created through FAL AI API.
This application is meant to be a form of entertainment for young children to allow them to create images using AI art.

We ensure a kid-friendly environment with our preselected options so prompts cannot be manipulated in any way.

   From there once they filled out the following, they will press the generate image button and see the artwork. If they don't like the result, there is a regenerate button.
